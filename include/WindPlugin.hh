  // The wind is described as a uniform worldwide model. So it is independant
  // from model position for simple computations. Its components are computed
  // separately:
  // - Horizontal amplitude:
  //      Low pass filtering on user input (complementary gain)
  //      + small local fluctuations
  //      + noise on value (noise amplitude is a factor of wind magnitude)
  //
  // - Horizontal direction:
  //      Low pass filtering on user input (complementary gain)
  //      + small local fluctuations
  //      + noise on value
  //
  // - Vertical amplitude:
  //      Noise proportionnal to wind magnitude.
